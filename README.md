# Misc-Tools
[![Python application](https://github.com/btakli/Misc-Tools/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/btakli/Misc-Tools/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

Contains both a CLI and GUI version, simple combination of various tools I have been asked to create by friends/used myself over the years. 
GUI version added for less technically savvy individuals.

Prerequisite:
You must install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) when using this program. On Mac if you have Homebrew installed you can try `brew install ffmpeg`
